This repository contains the questions and answers for the linux system programming event
conducted on drishti_12(both prelims and final round).
Most of this questions are the implementations of commonly used linux commands(coded in C).
Our aim behind conducting such an event was to make everyone familiar with  linux kernel API.
This will help them to write low level system programs and drivers etc.
